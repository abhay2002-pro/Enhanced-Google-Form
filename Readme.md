# Chosen Approach
- Utilizing a microservices architecture with a task queue for asynchronous processing. Each post-submission action, including Google Sheets integration, is handled by a dedicated microservice.

## Solution Architecture

### Data-Platform-Server

- Manages CRUD operations for forms, responses, questions, and companies.
- Raises events in Kafka upon data submission.

### Google-Sheet-Server

- Listens to the "form-submissions" Kafka topic.
- Parses messages and writes relevant data to Google Sheets.

### SMS-Server

- Listens to the "form-submissions" Kafka topic.
- Parses messages and sends SMS notifications based on response data.

## MongoDB Choice:
The choice of MongoDB was made due to the unstructured format of forms and responses. MongoDB's flexible schema allows for easy adaptation to changing requirements and supports the dynamic nature of form data.

# Database Design Specification

## 1. Companies Collection:
- **Collection Name:** `companies`
- **Attributes:**
  - `_id` (automatically generated by MongoDB)
  - `companyName` (String, required, unique)
  - `companyMetaData` (Object)

## 2. Forms Collection:
- **Collection Name:** `forms`
- **Attributes:**
  - `_id` (automatically generated by MongoDB)
  - `companyId` (Reference to `companies` collection, required)
  - `formName` (String, required)
  - `formMetaData` (Object)

## 3. Questions Collection:
- **Collection Name:** `questions`
- **Attributes:**
  - `_id` (automatically generated by MongoDB)
  - `formId` (Reference to `forms` collection, required)
  - `questionText` (String, required)
  - `questionType` (String, required, should be one of the predefined types in {text, multipleChoice, numeric, date})
  - `questionMetadata` (Object)

## 4. Responses Collection:
- **Collection Name:** `responses`
- **Attributes:**
  - `_id` (automatically generated by MongoDB)
  - `formId` (Reference to `forms` collection, required)
  - `responderPhoneNumber` (String, required)
  - `responseMetadata` (Object)
- **Index:** Ensure a unique index on `formId` and `responderPhoneNumber` to prevent duplicate responses for the same form from the same responder.

## Relationships:
- `companies` and `forms`: One-to-Many (One company can have multiple forms)
- `forms` and `questions`: One-to-Many (One form can have multiple questions)
- `forms` and `responses`: One-to-Many (One form can have multiple responses)

# Running the Code Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the code:

## Step 1: Start Docker Compose

Run the following command in your terminal to start the Docker containers:

```bash
docker-compose up
```
## Step 2: Create Kafka Topic

In a new terminal, execute the following command to create a Kafka topic:

```bash
docker exec -it kafka /opt/bitnami/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic form-submissions
```

## Step 3: Run Servers

Ensure that you first run the 'Data-Platform-Server' before the other two servers. Navigate to the 'Data-Platform-Server' directory in the terminal and execute:

```bash
npm start
```

After starting the 'Data-Platform-Server', you can proceed to start the other two servers in separate terminals using the same command.
